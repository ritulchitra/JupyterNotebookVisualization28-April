# Titanic Data Analysis

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle, and various steps were taken to clean and analyze the data before deriving insights.

## Workflow

1. **Data Download**:
   - The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle's Titanic dataset.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - The first step was to check the data for quality. This included:
     - Identifying missing values.
     - Checking for duplicate records.
   - Certain columns were converted to more human-friendly versions:
     - The `Survived` column, which originally contained `0` and `1`, was converted to `no` and `yes` for easier interpretation.
     - The `Embarked` column was similarly converted into more understandable values.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - I used Jupyter Notebook for performing the EDA.
   - I explored various aspects of the dataset, such as survival rates by gender, age, fare, and family relationships.
   - I used **Prompt Engineering** to leverage AI for code generation, which helped me automate certain parts of the process. After that, I refined and customized the AI-generated code to fit my analysis needs.

4. **Dataset**:
   - The primary dataset used for this analysis is the `train.csv` file, which was obtained from Kaggle.

5. **Notebook**:
   - The Jupyter Notebook titled `Titanic` contains the complete EDA process, along with visualizations and key findings.

## Files in this Repository:

- `train.csv`: The Titanic dataset used for analysis.
- `Titanic.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process.

## Tools and Libraries Used:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: For visualizations.
- **Deepseel/ChatGpt**: For code generation assistance.

## Conclusion:

Through this analysis, several interesting insights were derived, such as gender-based survival chances, the impact of fare class, the survival rates of young adults, and the influence of family ties. The project demonstrates a combination of traditional data analysis techniques along with modern AI tools to streamline and enhance the coding process.
